üöò Vehicle Detection and Face Blur using YOLOv8

This project detects vehicles and people using YOLOv8 object detection, and automatically blurs the faces of riders on two-wheelers or scooters. It produces two separate output videos:

1. YOLO Labels Output: Visualizes object detection with bounding boxes (YOLO-style).
2. Face Blur Output: Detects and blurs faces of riders and labels them as "human head".
